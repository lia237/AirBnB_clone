# AirBnB Clone

## Project Description

The AirBnB Clone project is a team collaboration aimed at developing a simplified version of Airbnb, with a focus on the command-line interface (CLI) for managing property-related objects. This project enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects such as users, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a fundamental component of this project. It serves as an interactive command-line interface for users to interact with the system. The interpreter facilitates various operations, including creating users and listings, booking properties, leaving reviews, and more. It acts as a bridge between the user and the underlying system, allowing for data management and manipulation.

## Getting Started

To start the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirBnB_clone.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd AirBnB_clone
Run the command interpreter:
./console
The interpreter will launch, and you'll be ready to enter commands.
How to Use
The command interpreter supports a variety of commands for managing objects. Here are some essential commands and their usage:

create: Create a new object (e.g., create a user or a listing).
show: Retrieve information about an object (e.g., display details of a specific listing).
update: Modify the attributes of an object (e.g., update the price of a listing).
destroy: Delete an object (e.g., remove a user or a booking).
all: List all objects of a specific type (e.g., list all users).
quit or EOF: Exit the interpreter.
For comprehensive command usage and documentation, please refer to the built-in help and documentation within the interpreter.

Examples
Here are some example commands you can use in the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter:

To create a new user:
```shell
(hbnb) create User email="user@example.com" password="password"
To display details of a specific listing:
```shell
(hbnb) show Listing 12345
To update the price of a listing:
```shell
(hbnb) update Listing 54321 price 150
To list all users:
